# Contributing

All contributions that are consistent with the philosophy of KSE are welcome! Please note that all code is under, and will perpetually be under, an MIT-like license. KSE deserves to be accessible to anyone and everyone, regardless of any circumstance.

## Issue tracker

Even if you can't code, reporting issues or asking for features can help guide KSE's development. Developers can't anticipate every use-case, and the only way to improve the user experience is through talking to users. For example, support for Spriter's image replacement was only possible thanks to a report from an end-user.

If opening an issue on the [Issues page](https://github.com/skairunner/kanimal-SE/issues) is intimidating, you can also [join the unofficial Oxygen Not Included server](https://discord.gg/EBncbX2
) and ping Skyrunner#1440. I will ignore any unsolicited friend requests, so please don't try to add me as a friend.
